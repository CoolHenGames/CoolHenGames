# Color Matcher privacy policy

The color matcher app does not explicitly collect any user data. Save data is stored on your device--we do not keep track of it. The game does, however, use Unity Ads to serve advertisements. Unity Ads uses your *advertising id* to give you a customized advertising experience. Their full data policy can be found [here](https://docs.unity.com/ads/GoogleDataSafety.html).
